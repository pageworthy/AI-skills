# Conversion Psychology for Landing Pages

## Core Principles

### 1. Loss Aversion
People fear losing more than they desire gaining. Frame benefits as what they'll miss without your solution.

**Instead of:** "Get peace of mind"
**Try:** "Stop wondering if your home is safe"

**Instead of:** "Save money"
**Try:** "Stop overpaying for security"

### 2. Social Proof
We look to others to determine correct behavior. Show that people like them have chosen you.

**Types:**
- Customer count: "375,000+ families trust Cove"
- Ratings: "4.7/5 from 5,300+ reviews"
- Testimonials: Specific quotes with names/photos
- Logos: "As seen on CBS, NBC, Fox"
- Case studies: Before/after results

**Placement:**
- Near CTAs (reduces friction)
- In hero section (immediate credibility)
- Below testimonials (reinforcement)

---

### 3. Authority
We defer to experts and trusted sources. Establish credibility early.

**Signals:**
- "Award-winning" + specific award name
- Certifications and licenses
- Media mentions
- Expert endorsements
- Years in business
- Partnership logos (Elizabeth Smart Foundation)

---

### 4. Scarcity & Urgency
Limited availability increases perceived value. Use only when genuine.

**Time-based:** "Offer ends Sunday"
**Quantity-based:** "Only 50 spots left"
**Conditional:** "First 100 customers get..."

**Warning:** Fake scarcity destroys trust. Only use real limits.

---

### 5. Reciprocity
When you give first, people feel compelled to give back.

**Apply with:**
- Free consultation
- Free camera with purchase
- Free guide/resource
- Risk-free trial

---

### 6. Commitment & Consistency
Small commitments lead to larger ones. Start with low-friction asks.

**Progression:**
1. "Take the quiz" (low commitment)
2. "See what it costs" (still exploring)
3. "Get your free quote" (more invested)
4. "Complete your order" (committed)

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections → Solutions

**"It's too expensive"**
- Compare to competitors ("Half the price of ADT")
- Break down cost ("Less than $1/day")
- Show value ("Professional monitoring included")

**"I don't have time"**
- Emphasize speed ("Set up in 15 minutes")
- Offer help ("Professional installation available")

**"I'm not sure it'll work for me"**
- Risk reversal ("60-day money-back guarantee")
- Specific testimonials from similar customers
- "No contract—cancel anytime"

**"I need to think about it"**
- Limited time offer (if genuine)
- Show what they're missing
- Remind of the problem they have
