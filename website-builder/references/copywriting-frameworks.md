# Copywriting Frameworks for Landing Pages

## AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

### Attention
- Bold, benefit-focused headline
- Unexpected stat or question
- Visual that stops the scroll

### Interest
- Expand on the headline promise
- Introduce the problem they face
- Show you understand their situation

### Desire
- Paint the after picture
- Social proof (testimonials, numbers)
- Features as benefits

### Action
- Clear, specific CTA
- Remove friction
- Add urgency if genuine

## PAS (Problem → Agitation → Solution)

### Problem
State the problem clearly and specifically:
> "You're paying $50/month for security that doesn't actually make you feel secure."

### Agitation
Twist the knife (ethically):
> "Every time you leave the house, you wonder. Every noise at night makes you check. The worry never stops."

### Solution
Present your offering as the answer:
> "Cove gives you 24/7 monitoring, instant alerts, and the peace of mind you've been missing—for less than $1/day."

## 4 Ps (Picture → Promise → Prove → Push)

### Picture
Paint a vivid mental image of life after:
> "Imagine getting a notification the moment your front door opens. Tapping your phone to see your kids walk in safely."

### Promise
Make a specific, believable promise:
> "Know they made it home safe—every single day."

### Prove
Back it up with evidence:
> "Join 375,000 families who trust Cove. 4.7/5 stars from 5,000+ reviews."

### Push
Give them a reason to act now:
> "Get 50% off equipment + a free camera. 60-day risk-free trial."

## Urgency & Scarcity

### Time-Based
- "Offer ends Sunday"
- "Price goes up January 1st"

### Quantity-Based
- "Only 50 spots available"
- "While supplies last"

### Natural Urgency
- "Before your contract renews"
- "Before winter hits"

**Warning:** Only use genuine urgency. Fake scarcity destroys trust.
